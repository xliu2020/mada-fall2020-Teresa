HOMEPAGE(ABOUT ME)

Hi! I am Xiaoying Liu. You can call me Teresa. 
Since I graduated form college last year, I have been looking for a path that enables me to struggle in San Francisco and I know what I need to do is to master language skill and professional skill. I used to work in ecommerce trading field to see how does an ecommercial business run. I also used to work in a restuarant to learn how to communicate with others. Now I am on my way to explore and master skills that required to become a web front-end developer or back-end developer. I think my decision won't come out until the back-end class end. 
On the other hand, I also enjoy visual digital design and like to create something new. In this portfolio, I will represent what I've learned and accomplished by Photoshop.Aiming to let people know how charming visual design can be, I am glad to bring out creative and interesting work to the public.

1 easy to navigate and all the contents are findable.

2 The design is simple but modern. As a portfolio for marketing, you can always see the contact form under every webpage, which I think it's a smart design. 

3 it needs a lot of words to describe the detail about them. but everything is well organized and I feel comfortable about that.

Dislike:

1 the color scheme of this portfolio is black, ghost white and purple. However, I personally think purple is not harmonius with other colors, especially when the portfolio is informational, which may cause eyes' fatigue.

2 it would be better if the work has category.
