    <h1>Help You Start Your Trip</h1>
        <p>
        Hi, my name is Xiaoying Liu and you can call me Teresa. I am going to introduce my hobby, travelling. I love travelling as a free walker because I can see new things, visit new places and meet with new people during the trip. In the same time, I can broaden my horizon and learn more history and stories about the new places. Also, compared with tourist group, individual tourists can be more flexible and have less limits for scheduling your routine.

         I believe that many people will be confused or worried about what to do to before their journey. In this webpage, I will show you how to start your trip before you set off. Before you start your trip, here are a few things you need to do. Hope that will help you.
        </p>

        <h2>investigate your destination</h2>
            <p>Since you want to have a perfect trip, you don’t want to depress yourself just because you didn’t check the opening time and date of your target spots beforehand or wear T-shirt and shorts but only to find that it is freezing when you arrive. So why not just investigate it completely in advance? Not only the opening times and weather, what spots you want to head for, what restaurants you may like, what’s the policy of spots, there are lots of stuff you need to do. If you have budget limits, you may start tracking cheap flights and cheap hotels at least 3 months before you set off.
            </p>
        <h2>Plan your route in advance</h2>
            <p>After you have done some research on the destination and you know what to expect, next step you need to do is route planning. Mark down the spots you prefer and plan your route according to the distance between spots. It would be better if you plan a loop or linear route, because you don’t want to overlap your route and take more time on the way. 
            </p>

        <h2>Buy tickets and make reservations</h2>
            <p>Now you have set your route, then you are good to buy spots tickets and flight tickets online. You’d better do it as soon as possible because some spots may have reservation policy or have limits on number of people and cheap flights will not always stay here and wait for your buying, especially in peak tourist seasons. Besides that, you‘d better book rooms for accommodation.   
            </p>
        <h2>Pack up your package</h2>
            <p>
            Before you are ready, you have left one thing to do, pack up your package. Generally, 3 sets of clothes will be good. Of course, you can bring some extra clothing depending on your needs or your research. Bring some snacks in case that you don’t have rest on your way and you’d better bring a spare tablet in case of some accidence happen.

        The more efforts you have made before the trip, the happier you will be during the trip. This is my personal experience. Though, it seems that there are a lot of things to do before the trip, but not exactly, you can finish all these things in just one website. They have more specific and professional tips which also help you in setting your route. What’s more, such websites have not only one. Here are some of my recommendations of websites.
